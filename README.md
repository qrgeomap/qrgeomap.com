# Project Overview

The **QR geomap project** aims to provide **the simplest way possible so that anyone with a smartphone can do an outdoor route**, lively seeing their location on a previously prepared map.

Key features:

- **A georeferenced map consists of a single image** (a png/jpeg file), which makes it **extremely easy to share** (by email, whatsapp, ...), publish on websites, blogs, social networks...
- **No need to install** any app. Web browser can be used, **even offline**.

This is a very simplified introduction to the project. For more information please visit:

# About this Repository (www.qrgeomap.com)
This repository contains the source code of the app published in [https://www.qrgeomap.com/](https://www.qrgeomap.com/).
It's a web app that allows to open a map (a QR geomap image file) and geolocate the map next to the user live position. 
It also provides a function to create maps: load a "track" file (GPX format) and generate a map image with the track drawn on it, which can be downloaded (as a PNG file) for later use.
