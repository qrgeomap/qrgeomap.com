# Project Overview

The **QR geomap project** aims to provide **the simplest way possible so that anyone with a smartphone can do an outdoor route**, lively seeing its location on a previously prepared map.

Key features:

- **The geolocated map consists of a single image** (a png/jpeg file), which makes it **extremely easy to share** (by email, whatsapp, ...), publish on websites, blogs, social networks...
- **No need to install** any app. Web browser can be used, **even offline**.

This is a very simplified introduction to the project. For more information please visit:
